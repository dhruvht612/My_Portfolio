## Why I built this

Most portfolio templates felt static and difficult to maintain at scale. I wanted a system where portfolio content could be managed like a lightweight CMS while still feeling modern, animated, and developer-focused.

This project became both my portfolio and an experiment in reusable frontend/admin architecture using React, Supabase, and modular UI systems.

---

## Overview

This repository is both a **public portfolio** and a **full content-management admin** for the same site. Visitors get multi-page navigation, motion-driven sections, and project discovery; you get an auth-protected `/admin` area to edit profile, experience, projects, skills, certifications, blog posts, education, messages, and analytics—without redeploying for every copy change.

| Surface | What you get |
| --- | --- |
| **Public site** | Hero, About, Projects, Beyond, Experience, Education, Certifications, Skills, Contact |
| **Admin CMS** | CRUD workspaces, multi-step forms, markdown editor, image upload, analytics charts |
| **Data layer** | Supabase-first with static fallback when env vars are missing |

---

## Architecture

High-level data flow for the portfolio + admin CMS.

<!-- When ready, add: ![Architecture diagram](docs/architecture.png) -->
*Optional: add a polished diagram at `docs/architecture.png`. Mermaid below renders on GitHub today.*

## Roadmap

Planned improvements (issues and PRs welcome):

| Status | Feature |
| --- | --- |
| 🔲 | **Public blog** — `/blog` and `/blog/:slug` on the portfolio site |
| 🔲 | **Real-time admin** — Supabase subscriptions for live list updates |
| 🔲 | **SEO per post** — Open Graph tags, descriptions, `og:image` from storage |
| 🔲 | **Scheduled publishing** — future `published_at` for blog/content |
| 🔲 | **Admin audit log** — who changed what and when |
| 🔲 | **Role-based access** — limited admin roles for collaborators |
| 🔲 | **Advanced analytics** — geography, sessions, bounce rate, export CSV/PDF |
| 🔲 | **Image transforms** — Supabase Image Transformation for uploads |
| 🔲 | **Contact webhooks** — Edge Function sync for notifications |
| 🔲 | **Architecture diagram asset** — `docs/architecture.png` for README |

## Reusable building blocks

Fork or copy these patterns into other React projects.

### Public components (`src/components/`)

| Component | Use case |
| --- | --- |
| `AnimatedSection` | Viewport-triggered fade/slide with stagger |
| `Hero` / `Landing` | Typing roles, CTAs, stats |
| `Projects` | Filterable project grid |
| `Skills` / `SkillProgressBar` | Animated proficiency bars |
| `SpaceBackground` | Layered ambient background |
| `SkipLink` / `ScrollToTop` | A11y + navigation helpers |
| `Toast` / `ChatWidget` | Feedback and lightweight chat UI |

### Admin primitives (`src/components/admin/`)

| Component / hook | Use case |
| --- | --- |
| `AdminForm` / `AdminFormWizard` | Zod-validated forms with multi-step flow |
| `DataTable` | Sortable lists with actions |
| `MarkdownEditor` | Rich text for blog/content |
| `ImageUploader` | Supabase Storage uploads |
| `TagInput` / `ArrayInput` | Dynamic list fields |
| `ConfirmDialog` / `EmptyState` | Safe deletes and zero-data UX |
| `AnalyticsChart` | Dashboard visualizations |
| `useAdminCrud` | Generic table list + insert/update/delete |

### UI kit (`src/components/ui/`)

| Component | Use case |
| --- | --- |
| `button` / `input` / `badge` | Base controls |
| `glowing-shadow` / `holographic-card` | Card emphasis |
| `particles-bg` / `shader-grid-background` | Background effects |
| `modern-animated-sign-in` | Auth screen polish |
| `interactive-logs-table-shadcnui` | Dense data tables |

Schemas in `src/schemas/` mirror admin forms and can be reused for API validation.

---

## Open-source value

Use this repo as a **starter for portfolio + CMS**, not only a résumé site.

- **Supabase-first CMS** — Edit content in production without touching JSON files
- **Graceful degradation** — Public pages still render from `src/data/` when Supabase is not configured
- **Documented backend plan** — See `docs/backend-integration-plan.md` for tables, RLS, and migrations
- **Seed & verify scripts** — `npm run seed`, `npm run verify:phase5` for reproducible setup
- **Vercel-ready build** — Production build fails fast if Supabase env is missing on Vercel (see `vite.config.js`)

**Good fits for forking:** developer portfolios, student project hubs, small team “about + work” sites with an internal admin.

```bash
# .env.local must include VITE_SUPABASE_URL + SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
npm run seed
npm run verify:phase5
```

---

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-public-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key   # scripts only — never expose to client

## Deployment

1. Run `npm run build`.
2. Deploy the `dist/` folder (Vercel recommended).
3. Set **SPA rewrites** so client routes serve `index.html`.
4. Add `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in the host’s environment settings.
5. Configure Supabase RLS policies, storage buckets, and run `npm run seed` if needed.

Details: [`docs/deployment.md`](docs/deployment.md)

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Check |
| --- | --- |
| 404 on refresh in production | SPA fallback / rewrite rules |
| Admin login fails | Supabase URL, anon key, and auth users |
| Empty admin or public data | RLS policies, seed script, table names |
| Contact inbox empty | `contact_submissions` insert policy |
| Vercel build fails on Supabase | Env vars on Production + redeploy |
| Stale styles or modules | `rm -rf node_modules && npm install` |
